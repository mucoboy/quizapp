# quizapp
Hi Developer,

ReactJS, BootStrap and Font Awesome are used in this project. If you need more information, please visit their offical websites.
https://react.dev/
https://getbootstrap.com/
https://fontawesome.com/

You can test this project completely via node.js ( after download "cd quizapp" then "npm start") or you may want to use only Quiz component in your project directly.

Please note that if you want to use only Quiz component (/components/Quiz.js) you should add bootstrap and fontawesome tags in your index.html file. You may find them inside public/index.html file.

If you have a rest api, you can use directly. Please check "getQuestion" function. Also, you can find your json example in "getDemo" function like below:

let demoQuestions = [

                {
                    question : "Complete the sentence: Hello, ... ?",
                    a: "Kitty!",
                    b: "Baby!",
                    c: "World!",
                    d: "React!",
                    e: "JS!",
                    answer:"c",
                    marked:""
                },

                {
                    question : "Which one is the programming language?",
                    a: "React",
                    b: "Spring",
                    c: ".Net",
                    d: "JavaScript",
                    e: "Bootstrap",
                    answer:"d",
                    marked:""
                },

                {
                    question : "Which statement returns true in if block?",
                    a: "Java === JavaScript",
                    b: "C === C++",
                    c: "C# === .Net",
                    d: "React === Angular",
                    e: "true || false",
                    answer:"e",
                    marked:""
                }
